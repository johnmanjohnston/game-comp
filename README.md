# Game Competition

# Installation
This game uses Unity build LTS 2022.3.18f1 (if you use another version, it will most likely not work)
and uses the URP (universal render pipeline), which allows for 2D lights

Install Unity from their website.
After installing Unity, open a project, and install the URP from Window -> Package Manager

If you're one of the programmers on this project, make sure have C# installed.
If you're using Visual Studio (strongly recommended if you're just starting out with Unity), modify your build of Visual Studio to inculde Unity IntelliSense. 
If you're using Visual Studio Code and you have C# already installed, just install the Unity extension from the marketplace.

### Programming Naming Conventions
Classes will be named using PascalCase, for example:
```cs
public class DemoClass { }
```

Variables will be named using camelCase, for example:
```cs
private float demoVariable;
```

However, static variables will be named using PascalCalse, for example:
```cs
public static float DemoStaticVariable;
```
